Overview

This project is a simple library management web application that allows users to add, display, remove, and update the reading status of books. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and stores books in an array. Users can interact with the application by adding new books through a form and viewing the list of books displayed on the page, either in a table or card format.

Each book can be edited to toggle its read status or deleted from the list altogether. This project serves as a basic exercise in DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
